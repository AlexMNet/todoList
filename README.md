# Todo Applicatoin

## With React Native

This is a basic todo application using react native. I followed a tutorial on youtube by Made with Matt
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kL6nhutjQ8" as a way to introduce myself to react native.

I have added an alert function that is fired when the add task button is pressed but no text is entered.
